# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my website!

This is the first ever post I'm making. This website was developed using a Jekyll theme called 'Chirpy'. The theme was taken from [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) and this website was developed by following [this](https://technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/) tutorial.

This website is hosted for free on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages allow you to host a website for free, but there's a requiremnt; the website has to be static.

It initially has an odd domain at the moment. But you can also have a custom domain if you want to. The only catch is you would have to pay for the custom domain ☹️.

The good thing is, if you are a student or somehow can't pay for both the hosting and the domain, GitHub Pages allow you to host for free, as well as provide a domain.
